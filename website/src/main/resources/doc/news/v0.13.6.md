# v0.13.6 bug-fix release

* 15.06.2021

* Bugfix: websocket client was failing to connect when no sub-protocol was specified (defaulting to `""`, which
  was incorrect)  
* Minor changes to improve error handling in the `fetch` module
  * `ResponseDecodeFailed` is gone, `ResponseError` is used instead
